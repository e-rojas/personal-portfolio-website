This is a second post.
Canada had to leave the Rugby World Cup tournament in Kamaishi, Japan, without a win Sunday, after their last game was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis.

But even though the cancellation of their Pool B game against Namibia was disappointing to the men's rugby team, they still managed to turn the experience into a rewarding one by helping clean up flood-ravaged areas of the city. 

World Rugby issued a statement Oct. 12 saying an evacuation order remained in place in the Kamaishi area and there had been landslides and flooding in the vicinity of the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium.
